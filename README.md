# KomPlot

KomPlot provides a convenience layer around selected [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) plotting functions, making it possible to construct a useful plot in a single function call, which is particularly useful for use within an interactive [ipython](https://ipython.org) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) session. KomPlot also provides a number of interactive controls, including zooming by mouse wheel scroll, colormap shifts when viewing images, and shifting between displayed slices of a volume.
